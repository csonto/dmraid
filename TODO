-- dmraid 1.0.0.rc11 TODO --					2006.05.15

o more enhancements for RAID set consistency checks

o neater -s output; something better than just paragraphs
  for super- and subsets ?

o higher RAID levels above 1; main restriction to support these is
  the need for device-mapper targets which map RAID4 and RAID5
  (Alpha patch for device-mapper RAID4/RAID5 target on my people page now)

o MD metadata format handler

o SNIA DDF metadata format handler

o enhance metadata write feature in order to be able to store state changes
  persistently; needs an event() method to inform the metadata handler about
  state changes recognized eg, at the device-mapper interface layer

o event daemon linked to libdmraid which keeps track of RAID device and set
  state changes (eg, io errors) and decides about degration etc.;
  dmeventd coded; needs library for dmraid access

o more cleanup and enhance debug and verbose output

o support other partitions than MSDOS on Software RAID devices or
  use kpartx instead ?

o regular expressions for metadata format, RAID device and RAID set selection

o does dmraid need a config file ?
